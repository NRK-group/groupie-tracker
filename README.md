Receive API
Manipulate the date contained in it
Create a site to display the information

## TASK
Build a user friendly website where you display the bands info through several data visualizations:
- Blocks
- Cards
- Tables
- List
- Pages
- Graphics

Focus on the creation of events/actions and on their visualization
- The event/action we want you to do is known as a client call to the server (client-server). We can say it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action must communicate with the server in order to receive information, [request-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)
- An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

## Requirements
- Backend must be written in Go
- Site and server cannot crash at any time
- All pages must work correctly and you must take car of any errors

## This project will help you learn about :
Manipulation and storage of data.
JSON files and format.
HTML.
Event creation and display.
Client-server.
